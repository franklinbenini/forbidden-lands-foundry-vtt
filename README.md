<p align="center">'Round the beggar from Varassa all sat in a ring, <br />and by the campfire they sat and heard his song. <br />About walkers and wolfkin and every terrible thing, <br />and of his fear he sang to them all night long:</p>
<p align="center"><em>"There is something beyond the mountains, <br />beyond the howls beyond the mist, <br />there is something behind the veils, <br />behind hearts cold as stone. <br />Hearken, something walks and whispers, <br />walks and lures you in and whimpers: <br />Come to us, for this earth shall ever be ours and ours alone!"</em></p>
